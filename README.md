Creating a comprehensive README file is an essential aspect of your GitHub repository. It serves as the first point of contact for anyone who visits your repository, providing them with an understanding of what your project is about, how to set it up, and how to use it. Below is a template for a README file for your repository, which contains a command-line shell and a GUI shell, both written in C and based on the tutorial from Hacker Noon and the 'lets-build-a-linux-shell' GitHub repository.

# Custom C Shells: CLI & GUI

## About

This repository hosts two distinct shells implemented in C: a command-line interface (CLI) shell and a graphical user interface (GUI) shell. Inspired by a [Hacker Noon tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/u/MIMA) and the practical approach demonstrated in the [lets-build-a-linux-shell](https://github.com/moisam/lets-build-a-linux-shell) GitHub repository, these shells are designed to provide hands-on experience with the internals of command interpreters in Linux.

### Features

- **Command-Line Shell**: A basic shell that runs in the terminal, allowing users to execute commands and scripts in a traditional text-based environment.
- **GUI Shell**: An extension of the command-line shell with a graphical interface, making it more accessible and user-friendly, especially for those who prefer graphical over text-based interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- GTK+ 3.0 (for the GUI shell)
- Basic knowledge of C and Linux environment

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
    cd [YourRepoName]
    ```

2. **Build the Command-Line Shell**

    Navigate to the command-line shell directory:

    ```bash
    cd CLI Shell
    make
    ```

3. **Build the GUI Shell**

    Ensure GTK+ 3.0 is installed, then navigate to the GUI shell directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../GUI Shell
    gcc -o shell executor.c initsh.c main.c node.c parser.c prompt.c scanner.c source.c builtins/builtins.c builtins/dump.c symtab/symtab.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0)
    ```

### Usage

- **Running the CLI Shell**: In the `CLI Shell` directory, execute `./shell`.
- **Running the GUI Shell**: In the `GUI Shell` directory, execute `./shell`.
